# Ruff House

Ruff House is a React/Ruby on Rails single page pet sitter booking app. I built this app so pet owners could request pet sitting jobs and pet sitters could claim them (essentially the reverse of the Rover app). You can create either a Pet Owner or a Pet Sitter user account. Owners can add pets to their 'Doggo House' and create job requests. Sitters can set their daily rate & claim job requests. Both users can edit their profile information.

## Deployed App (Recommended)

The easiest way to see the app in action is to view the deployed verison [here](https://ruff-house.onrender.com/signin).

## Installation (Alternative)

Fork and Clone Repo down to local environment
Navigate into that directory
```bundle install
npm install && npm start --prefix client/
```

## Dashboards

Once logged in, you will see either the owner dashboard or the sitter dashboard depending on your user type.

### Owners can see:
- Requested jobs carousel (with a button that allows them to create a new request)
- Booked jobs carousel (with total cost of job & sitter who booked it)
- Completed jobs
- List of their pets (with a button that allows them to add a new pet) 

### Sitters can see:
- Booked jobs carousel
- Completed jobs carousel
- Side menu includes a menu item called Jobs that lists of all of the available jobs
